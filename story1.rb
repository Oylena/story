#   Hey, rao, how its going?! Look, please, under any circumstances don't touch EMAIL DELIVERING module!
# Our sysadmins hardly established ssl proxy signing of email traffic, and if you make
# any change in that module, you will have to regenerate cerificate keys all night till morning..
# I just caution. I exactly  know that  EMAIL DELIVERING module is not the reason of the bugs.
# Good luck!

#   As you see, this task is very special and uniqe. The main goal, is to
# allow you to lose courage, inside big foreign project.
#   The tasks maybe is unclear for you - it is a standard in industry, you should learn to understand
# how to ask the question. The programming required skills there - is low level. You can try
#    to use just your intuition.
# Tip:   closely  look for  situation around this story, look a outputted result of the script,
#   and perform a 2 little changes (it is possible to do in a different ways here).
# You can write a questions for "Adam Stain" - your virtual customer. Asking IS welcome, if you needed it.
#$

#$  GOOD LUCK!
